<h2>Goals</h2>

# Mole Madness:
Design a game board using HTML and CSS with mole elements that pop up randomly.
Implement JavaScript logic to control the appearance and disappearance of moles.
Increase the player's score each time a mole is successfully clicked.

#Challenge by Time:
Introduce timed intervals for mole appearances, making the game progressively challenging.
Implement a countdown timer to keep track of the player's performance.

#Dynamic Difficulty:
Add a random delay between mole pop-ups to add unpredictability.
Gradually reduce the interval between mole appearances to raise the stakes.

#Interactive UI:
Create an interactive interface with engaging visuals for moles and a hammer cursor.
Display the player's score and remaining time to enhance gameplay feedback.

#Sound Effects (Optional):
Incorporate sound effects to enhance player immersion.
Trigger sounds for mole appearances, successful clicks, and game-over scenarios.

#Advanced Challenges (Optional):
Explore more complex game development concepts, such as moving enemies, trajectories, bullets, or timers.
Experiment with creating other classic games like PacMan, Snake, FlappyBird, Pong, Space Invaders, Bomberman, or Timed Chess.
